# Instructions

There is a Git server used by the Nautilus project teams. Recently a new developer `Jon`joined the team and needs to start working on a project. To do so, he needs to fork an existing Git repository. Below you can find more details:

- Click on the `Gitea UI` button on the top bar. You should be able to access the `Gitea` page.
- Login to `Gitea` server using username `jon` and password `Jon_pass123`.
- There you will see a Git repository `sarah/story-blog`, `fork` it under `jon` user.

`Note:` For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.
