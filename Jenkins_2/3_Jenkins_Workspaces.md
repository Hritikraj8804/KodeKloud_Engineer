# Instructions

Some developers are working on a common repository where they are testing some features for an application. They are having three branches (excluding the master branch) in this repository where they are adding changes related to these different features. They want to test these changes on Stratos DC app servers so they need a Jenkins job using which they can deploy these different branches as per requirements. Configure a Jenkins job accordingly.

Click on the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.

Similarly, click on `Gitea` button to access the Gitea page. Login to `Gitea` server using username `sarah` and password `Sarah_pass123`.

1. There is a Git repository named `web_app` on Gitea where developers are pushing their changes. It has three branches `version1`, `version2` and `version3` (excluding the `master` branch). You need not to make any changes in the repository.
2. Create a Jenkins job named `app-job`.
3. Configure this job to have a choice parameter named `Branch` with choices as given below:

`version1`
