# Instructions

A developer named kirsty has been assigned `Nautilus` project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for kirsty. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.
