# Instructions

The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have decided to use Jenkins
 server. So, we need to setup a `Jenkins Server` as soon as possible. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:

1. Install `jenkins` on jenkins server using `yum` utility only, and start its `service`. You might face timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, please refer [this](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/systemd-services/#starting-services) link for help.

2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `Ammar` and email should be `ammar@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.
